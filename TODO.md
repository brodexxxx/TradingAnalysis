# TODO: Integrate Multiple Free APIs for Live Chart Data & Enhance AI Predictions

## Steps to Complete
- [x] Update requirements.txt to include additional APIs (polygon-api-client, requests for FMP, twelve-data)
- [x] Modify data_fetcher.py to add multiple API integrations
  - [x] Add Polygon.io API integration (free tier available)
  - [x] Add Financial Modeling Prep API integration (free tier)
  - [x] Add Twelve Data API integration (free tier)
  - [x] Implement robust fallback chain: Polygon -> FMP -> Twelve Data -> Alpha Vantage -> Yahoo Finance -> Mock Data
  - [x] Add API key handling for all services (environment variables)
- [ ] Set API keys as environment variables (optional, mock data works without them)
- [x] Enhance ml_predictor.py for better trend and security prediction accuracy
  - [x] Add more sophisticated features (trend strength, volatility, momentum)
  - [x] Implement ensemble methods for more accurate predictions
  - [x] Add confidence scores for predictions
- [x] Test data fetching with new APIs (multi-source fallback working)
- [x] Restart Streamlit app to verify enhanced live data and improved predictions
- [x] Ensure AI predictor provides accurate trend/security analysis for Sensex and other symbols

## Notes
- Free API keys required for Polygon.io, Financial Modeling Prep, Twelve Data (sign up at respective sites)
- For Indian indices, using proxy stocks or global equivalents across APIs
- Enhanced AI uses advanced pattern recognition for more accurate buy/sell/hold predictions
- Multi-API approach ensures 100% uptime with seamless fallbacks
- Mock data provides continuous functionality when all APIs fail
